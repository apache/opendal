# OpenDAL Release

## Overview

Use this skill for Apache OpenDAL release-manager work. Treat releases as a state machine with externally visible legal and distribution effects, not as ordinary CI chores.

The primary repository runbook is `website/community/release/release.md`. The split source artifact source of truth is `dev/src/release/package.rs`. Read the relevant source in the current checkout when first needed. Reuse that context across release stages; refresh the affected sections when the checkout or source changes, or when an unresolved question requires it.

## Ground Rules

- Use `gh` for GitHub PRs, issues, discussions, checks, and Actions logs.
- Do not use web search for repository state. Query live GitHub, SVN, Nexus, crates.io, PyPI, npm, and Maven URLs directly.
- Do not claim any step succeeded until the external system confirms it.
- Treat an RC as bound to its tag, target commit, and signed source artifacts. Manual RC tags are signed; weekly preparation creates a lightweight tag and compose signs the artifacts. Do not create a new RC merely because `main` advances after tagging.
- Do not assume bindings or integrations share the top-level OpenDAL version. Each released binding or integration can have its own version.
- Do not start a public vote with broken links, open Maven staging, missing source artifacts at the selected staging location, or incomplete required workflows.
- Do not conflate Nexus `Close` before voting with Nexus `Release` after the vote passes.
- Do not over-block on unrelated/noncritical CI if the release gate is explicitly narrowed.
- Do not put SVN, Nexus, or mail credentials in commands, files, issue text, PRs, or release notes. Read them from environment variables or an interactive prompt and avoid shell history when possible.
- Commit messages and public release text must not include agent attribution.

## Version Scope Rules

OpenDAL releases have multiple version scopes:

- `opendal_version`: the final core OpenDAL release version, for example `0.56.0`.
- `release_version`: the RC directory and RC tag version, for example `0.56.0-rc.4`.
- Package versions: the versions of individual core, binding, and integration packages listed in `dev/src/release/package.rs`.

Rules:

- Use `release_version` for RC tags, vote titles, staged website URLs, and ASF SVN `dist/dev/opendal/${release_version}/` directories.
- Use `opendal_version` for the final release tag and ASF SVN `dist/release/opendal/${opendal_version}/`.
- Use package-specific versions for generated source archive names, package repository checks, and language binding or integration readiness.
- When verifying artifacts, build an explicit package-to-version map from `dev/src/release/package.rs`; do not infer binding or integration versions from `opendal_version`.
- When checking upgrade docs, only check released bindings and integrations that appear in the current package list, and only add upgrade notes for components with breaking changes.

## Release State Model

Use these states explicitly when reporting status:

1. `planning`: release discussion/tracking issue/version bump not done.
2. `bump-pr`: version/changelog/upgrade/dependency updates are in PR.
3. `crates-bootstrapped`: the bootstrap workflow has authenticated every Rust crate in the scanned `main` publish plan, and every name exists with the exact Trusted Publisher and `trustpub_only` enabled.
4. `rc-tagged`: RC tag exists and was pushed at the intended commit.
5. `rc-ci`: required release workflows, triggered by tag push or explicit dispatch, are still running or failed.
6. `artifacts-built`: local release tooling or source compose generated ASF source artifacts.
7. `source-staged`: signed artifacts are uploaded to ATR compose or ASF SVN `dist/dev`; record which location and revision will be verified.
8. `nexus-closed`: Java staging repo is closed and publicly accessible.
9. `vote-open`: the formal vote is open and identifies the verified candidate and source location.
10. `vote-passed`: at least 72 hours elapsed and binding vote requirements are met.
11. `official-release`: final tag, approved source publication, package repositories, GitHub release, and announcement are complete.

Weekly preparation replaces the manual bump-PR path and can compose sources while downstream builds run. A candidate-ready Discussion confirms upload and dispatch, not readiness to vote.

Retry transient failures against the same candidate and reuse existing signed artifacts. Create a new RC when source or workflow changes must be included, or the candidate is rejected; do not regenerate an RC merely to recover a missing dispatch or a staging permission failure.

## Choose the Current Phase

Load only the references needed for the requested phase or unresolved issue. Continue from the established release state; opening this skill does not require restarting release preparation. References retain phase-specific gates and command examples. Repository paths and shell commands are relative to the repository root; Markdown links are relative to their containing file.

- [Preparation](references/preparation.md): start a release or prepare version, changelog, and upgrade updates.
- [Rust crate bootstrap](references/rust-bootstrap.md): reserve crate names or inspect the protected bootstrap prerequisites.
- [Release candidate](references/rc.md): prepare a weekly ATR candidate or manual RC, inspect required CI, recover missing dispatches, stage source artifacts, or close Nexus staging.
- [Go readiness](references/go.md): release or verify Go bindings and service modules when Go is in scope.
- [Rust readiness](references/rust.md): inspect the publish plan, packaging constraints, or release helper CI.
- [Vote](references/vote.md): check pre-vote readiness, prepare the vote, or determine and publish its result.
- [Official release](references/official-release.md): publish after the vote passes and complete release follow-up.
- [Troubleshooting](references/troubleshooting.md): diagnose a matching CI, registry, staging, or authentication failure.
