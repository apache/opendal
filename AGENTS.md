# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## General Rules

- Use English in repository files: code, comments, commit messages, PR titles, PR bodies, and technical docs.
- Add comments only when they explain non-obvious intent or constraints.
- Add tests when they verify real behavior or guard a regression; do not add placeholder tests.
- Do not change public APIs or behavior tests unless the task explicitly requires it.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

Follow [AI-Assisted Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-assisted-contributions)
policy.

- Do not publish an Issue, Pull Request, Discussion, or review comment unless a
  human has meaningfully reviewed the content and explicitly asked you to submit
  it.
- Do not implement or submit a service-specific change based only on source-code
  analysis, a mock or emulator, a synthetic malformed response, or another
  service's implementation. Reproduce the problem against the actual service
  first.
- If actual-service reproduction is unavailable, stop before changing code or
  opening a Pull Request. Raise the hypothesis in a Discussion unless a
  maintainer has explicitly accepted it as a hardening or maintenance goal.
- A test against a fabricated response can verify implementation behavior, but
  it does not establish that the change solves a real-world problem.
- In a Pull Request, briefly disclose AI's material role and any assumptions or
  unknowns that affect review. Do not repeat routine validation output.

The human contributor remains responsible for every submitted claim and change.

## Helper Functions

- Extract a helper only when it owns a stable, cohesive responsibility, such as
  a non-trivial invariant or algorithm, shared protocol encoding with identical
  semantics, a state-machine transition, or a trait or interface boundary.
- Do not introduce an intermediate type or helper merely to deduplicate a short
  condition, merge, forwarding step, request parameter, or error mapping.
  Prefer a few duplicated lines when they keep each operation easier to read
  and maintain in isolation.
- Keep operation-specific validation, lowering, request construction, and
  response handling at the dispatch, request-builder, or response-processing
  boundary that owns the behavior. A reader should be able to see how one
  operation maps its options without following a chain of generic helpers.
- Before sharing code, verify that the call sites have the same contract,
  inputs, failure semantics, and reasons to change. Similar syntax alone does
  not justify an abstraction.
- Reuse an existing helper only when it already expresses the same contract. Do
  not broaden it with operation-specific branches merely to obtain reuse.

## Documentation Style

- Prefer active voice. Name the type or component that performs an action, for example, “`RetryLayer` retries failed operations.”
- Use direct, present-tense sentences.
- Lead with what a public type or method does, then explain important constraints, defaults, and behavior.
- Describe API semantics precisely. Verify option types, capability requirements, error behavior, and overwrite or versioning semantics against the implementation.
- Keep terminology consistent with the codebase, especially `service`, `layer`, `operator`, `storage` and `operation`.
- Use parallel structure in lists and punctuate complete sentences consistently.

## Documentation Architecture

OpenDAL splits documentation by audience. The website carries only content
that holds for OpenDAL across languages; Rust-specific documentation lives in
rustdoc.

- `core/core/src/docs/specs/` contains the living portable contracts, the one
  set of documents published to both destinations. Rustdoc publishes them
  under `opendal::docs::specs`; the website reads the same Markdown at
  `/docs/specifications/`.
- `core/core/src/docs/concepts.rs`, `core/core/src/docs/internals/`, and
  `core/core/src/docs/performance/` contain the Rust core guides: Rust types,
  traits, implementation architecture, runtime resources, and transport
  tuning. They are rustdoc-only; do not publish them on the website.
- `website/docs/` contains cross-language concepts and non-normative guidance,
  plus the per-language guides. Content there must hold for OpenDAL as a
  whole. Do not present Rust implementation detail as cross-language behavior,
  and do not claim every binding exposes a feature (layers, builders,
  concurrency controls) unless the bindings demonstrate it.
- `core/core/src/docs/rfcs/` contains immutable accepted design history. An
  accepted RFC records the proposal that reached consensus; update a
  specification, not the accepted RFC, when the current contract changes.
- `core/core/src/docs/upgrade.md` contains upgrade procedures, and
  `CHANGELOG.md` contains the release changelog. Rustdoc exposes them through
  `opendal::docs`.
- `website/docusaurus.config.js` and `website/specifications.sidebars.js`
  define website publication and navigation for the specifications. Do not add
  a website section that republishes rustdoc content, and do not copy
  specifications into `website/docs/`.

Public API documentation under `core/core/src/types/` must explain the
observable behavior, capability requirements, and relevant errors at the API
site. Link to a specification only after the local API contract is
self-contained.

## Rust Workspace Commands

The Rust workspace for OpenDAL core lives under `core/`. There is no root `Cargo.toml`; run core cargo commands from `core/`.

```bash
cd core

# Check and build
cargo check
cargo build --locked
cargo build --all-features --locked

# Lint, matching Core CI
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Lint a focused service/layer feature set
cargo clippy --all-targets --features=services-s3 -- -D warnings

# Unit tests, matching Core CI
cargo nextest run --workspace --no-fail-fast --all-features

# Doc tests and docs
cargo test --workspace --doc --all-features
cargo doc --lib --no-deps --all-features

# Behavior tests
OPENDAL_TEST=s3 cargo test behavior --features tests,services-s3

# Format core workspace
cargo fmt --all
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

Repository-wide format checks run from the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/workspace.py cargo fmt -- --check
taplo format --check
```

Code generation and release helpers also run from the repository root:

```bash
just generate python
just generate java
just update-version
just release
```

## Current Architecture

OpenDAL's Rust core has been split into a facade crate plus smaller core, service, and layer crates.

- `core/Cargo.toml`: Rust workspace root and `opendal` facade package.
- `core/src/lib.rs`: facade crate that re-exports `opendal-core`, wires optional service/layer crates, and registers enabled services for `Operator::from_uri` / `Operator::via_iter`.
- `core/core/`: `opendal-core`, containing public core types, raw traits, shared layers, HTTP utilities, docs, RFCs, and the always-available memory service.
- `core/services/<service>/`: standalone service crates named `opendal-service-*`.
- `core/layers/<layer>/`: standalone layer crates named `opendal-layer-*`.
- `core/testkit/`: behavior-test support.
- `core/tests/behavior/`: core behavior test entrypoint.
- `integrations/`: ecosystem integrations such as `object_store`, `parquet`, `dav-server`, `unftp-sbe`, and Spring.
- `bindings/`: language bindings; each binding has its own build/test conventions.
- `website/`: documentation website.
- `dev/`: repository maintenance, code generation, and release tooling used by `just`.

Important consequences of the split:

- Service and layer code no longer lives under `core/src/services` or `core/src/layers`.
- Public API changes usually touch `core/core/src/...` and the facade exports in `core/src/lib.rs`.
- Optional user-facing features are declared in `core/Cargo.toml` as `services-*` and `layers-*`, and usually map to optional `opendal-service-*` / `opendal-layer-*` dependencies.
- The memory service is in `core/core/src/services/memory`; `services-memory` is a deprecated compatibility feature because memory is always enabled.

## Service Implementation Pattern

Most services follow this shape under `core/services/<name>/`:

- `src/lib.rs`: crate docs, module declarations, public builder/config exports, and service registration function.
- `src/backend.rs`: builder and `opendal_core::raw::Access` implementation.
- `src/config.rs`: serializable config and builder conversion.
- `src/core.rs`: shared service client, request construction, and service-specific helpers.
- `src/error.rs`: service-specific error parsing.
- `src/reader.rs`, `src/writer.rs`, `src/lister.rs`, `src/deleter.rs`, `src/copier.rs`: operation implementations when the service needs them.
- `src/docs.md`: service docs included into rustdoc.

When adding or changing a service:

1. Put implementation in `core/services/<service>/`.
2. Implement `Builder` and `Access` using `opendal_core`.
3. Add or update the facade feature and optional dependency in `core/Cargo.toml`.
4. Register the service in `core/src/lib.rs` when it should support URI/iterator construction.
5. Add or update behavior-test setup under `.github/services/<service>/` when real backend testing is needed.
6. Run focused clippy/tests first, then broaden validation based on the blast radius.

## Layer Implementation Pattern

Reusable layers live under `core/layers/<layer>/` as `opendal-layer-*` crates. Core layers that are required by `opendal-core` itself live under `core/core/src/layers/`.

When adding or changing a public optional layer:

1. Put reusable optional code in `core/layers/<layer>/`.
2. Depend on `opendal-core` and implement `Layer` / `LayeredAccess` against `opendal_core::raw`.
3. Add or update the corresponding `layers-*` feature and optional dependency in `core/Cargo.toml`.
4. Re-export it from the facade when users should access it through `opendal::layers`.

## Testing Expectations

- Use `cargo fmt --all -- --check` for Rust formatting inside `core/`; use `./scripts/workspace.py cargo fmt -- --check` for the repository-wide format check.
- For core changes, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` is the CI-level lint gate.
- For behavior changes, run the narrow behavior test, for example `OPENDAL_TEST=s3 cargo test behavior --features tests,services-s3`.
- Behavior tests require backend credentials or fixture setup. Use `.env.example`, `fixtures/`, and `.github/services/<service>/` as the source of truth for service-specific setup.
- Integration crates under `integrations/` have their own CI workflows and should be validated in their own directories when touched.
- Binding changes should follow the binding's local README/build files and the matching `.github/workflows/ci_bindings_*.yml`.

## Pull Requests

- Before opening a PR, search for similar open PRs, issues, and in-progress branches that already address the same problem. Prefer contributing to or coordinating with existing work over opening a duplicate.
- Always use `.github/pull_request_template.md` when creating a PR.
- Keep PR titles and descriptions factual and concise.
- Do not add AI-tool branding or co-author trailers.
- If public APIs or user-facing behavior change, update docs and call out the user-facing impact in the PR template.

## Important Notes

- Minimum Rust version is 1.91, configured in `core/Cargo.toml` and checked by CI.
- Use `opendal_core::raw::Access`, `Layer`, and `LayeredAccess` for internal implementations.
- Use `opendal_core::raw::oio::{ReadStream, Write, List, Delete}` for operation bodies.
- Use `Operator` and `blocking::Operator` as the public API entry points.
