## Your First Contribution

1. Ensure your change has an issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues) or [open a new issue](https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues/new).
1. [Fork the OpenDAL repository](https://github.com/apache/opendal/fork) in your own GitHub account.
1. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
1. Make your changes.
1. [Submit the branch as a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the main OpenDAL repo. An OpenDAL team member should comment and/or review your pull request within a few days. Although, depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.

## Workflow

### Git Branches

*All* changes must be made in a branch and submitted as [pull requests](#github-pull-requests). OpenDAL does not adopt any type of branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### GitHub Pull Requests

Once your changes are ready you must submit your branch as a [pull request](https://github.com/apache/opendal/pulls).

#### Title

The pull request title must follow the format outlined in the [conventional commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) is a standardized format for commit messages. OpenDAL only requires this format for commits on the `main` branch. And because OpenDAL squashes commits before merging branches, this means that only the pull request title must conform to this format.

The following are all good examples of pull request titles:

```text
feat(services/gcs): Add start-after support for list
docs: add hdfs classpath related troubleshoot
ci: Mark job as skipped if owner is not apache
fix(services/s3): Ignore prefix if it's empty
refactor: Polish the implementation of webhdfs
```

#### Reviews & Approvals

All pull requests should be reviewed by at least one OpenDAL committer.

#### Merge Style

All pull requests are squash merged.
We generally discourage large pull requests that are over 300â€“500 lines of diff.
If you would like to propose a change that is larger, we suggest
coming onto our [Discussions](https://github.com/apache/opendal/discussions) and discussing it with us.
This way we can talk through the solution and discuss if a change that large is even needed!
This will produce a quicker response to the change and likely produce code that aligns better with our process.

### CI

Currently, OpenDAL uses GitHub Actions to run tests. The workflows are defined in `.github/workflows`.

## Setup

For small or first-time contributions, we recommend the dev container method. Prefer to do it yourself? That's fine too!

### Using a dev container environment

OpenDAL provides a pre-configured [dev container](https://containers.dev/)
that could be used in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces),
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/),
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Please pick up your favourite runtime environment.

The fastest way is:

### Bring your own toolbox

OpenDAL is primarily a Rust project. To build OpenDAL, you will need to set up Rust development first. We highly recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for the setup process.

For Linux or macOS, use the following command:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

For Windows, download `rustup-init.exe` from [here](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64) instead.

Rustup will read OpenDAL's `rust-toolchain.toml` and set up everything else automatically. To ensure that everything works correctly, run `cargo version` under OpenDAL's root directory:

```shell
$ cargo version
cargo 1.69.0 (6e9a83356 2023-04-12)
```

Some components may require specific setup steps. Please refer to their respective `CONTRIBUTING` documentation for more details.
