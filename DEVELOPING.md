## Setup

We're super excited to have you interested in working on OpenDAL! Before you start you should pick how you want to develop.

For small or first-time contributions, we recommend the devcontainer method. Prefer to do it yourself? That's fine too!

### Using a devcontainer environment

OpenDAL provides a pre-configured [dev container](https://containers.dev/) that could be used in [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/), [JuptyerLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Please pick up your favourite runtime environment.

The fastest way is:
