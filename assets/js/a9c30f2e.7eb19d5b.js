Look to see if your preferred \n    ID is already taken at \n    https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html\n    This will allow the Secretary to notify the PMC \n    when your iCLA has been recorded.\n\nWhen recording of your iCLA is noted, you will \nreceive a follow-up message with the next steps for \nestablishing you as a committer.\n\nWith the expectation of your acceptance, welcome!\n\n${your_name} (as represents of The Apache OpenDAL PMC)\n"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"add-the-candidate-to-the-committer-list",children:"Add the candidate to the committer list"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["After the candidate accepts the invitation and the iCLA is recorded, add the candidate to the committer list by ",(0,i.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/opendal",children:"whimsy roster tools"})]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(n.img,{src:t(4695).A+"",width:"1598",height:"494"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"announcement",children:"Announcement"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Once the nominee accepts the invitation and the commit bit is granted, it's encouraged to send an announcement email to ",(0,i.jsx)(n.a,{href:"mailto:dev@opendal.apache.org",children:"dev@opendal.apache.org"})," to welcome the new committers.
