`oli` stands for OpenDAL Command Line Interface. It aims to provide a unified and user-friendly way to manipulate data stored in various storage service.

## How to use `oli`

`oli` provide basic sub-commands like `oli ls`, `oli cat`, `oli stat`, `oli cp`, `oli rm`, and `oli bench` just like what you use on your local filesystem.

### Install `oli`

`oli` could be installed by `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install oli
```

> `cargo` is the Rust package manager. `cargo` could be installed by following the [Installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) from Rust official website.

### Configure `oli` Profile

`oli` requires a config file to work, it should be:

- `~/.config/oli/config.toml` on Linux
- `~/Library/Application Support/oli/config.toml` on macOS
- `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\oli\config.toml` on Windows

The content of `config.toml` should follow these pattern:

```toml
[profiles.<profile_name>]
configuration_key1 = "value1"
configuration_key2 = "value2"

[profiles.<another_profile_name>]
configuration_key3 = "value3"
configuration_key4 = "value4"

```

Here is an example of `config.toml`:

```toml
[profiles.s3]
type = "s3"
root = "/assets"
bucket = "<bucket>"
region = "<region>"
endpoint = "https://s3.amazonaws.com"
access_key_id = "<access_key_id>"
secret_access_key = "<secret_access_key>"

[profiles.r2]
type = "s3"
root = "/assets"
bucket = "<bucket>"
region = "auto"
endpoint = "https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
access_key_id = "<access_key_id>"
secret_access_key = "<secret_access_key>"
```

For different services, you could find the configuration keys in the corresponding [service document](https://docs.rs/opendal/0.50.2/opendal/services/index.html).

### Example: use `oli` to upload file to AWS S3

```shell
oli cp ./update-ecs-loadbalancer.json s3:/update-ecs-loadbalancer.json
oli ls s3:/
# fleet.png
# update-ecs-loadbalancer.json
```

### Example: use `oli` copy file from S3 to R2

```shell
oli cp s3:/fleet.png r2:/fleet.png
oli ls r2:/
# fleet.png
```

### Example: use `oli` bench command

use the oli config file or create a new config file for bench command

Here is an example of `config.toml` using bench command:

```toml
[profiles.demo]
type = "s3"
access_key_id = "minioadmin"
secret_access_key = "minioadmin"
bucket = "test-bucket"
endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:9000"
region = "us-east-1"
root = "/benchmarks"
enable_virtual_host_style = "false"
```

create a bench suite config file

Here is an example of `suite.toml`:

```toml
file_size = "64MiB"
parallelism = 4
timeout = "60s"
workload = "upload"
```

then can use bench command use config file and suite file

```shell
oli bench --config config.toml demo suite.toml
```

## Branding

The first and most prominent mentions must use the full form: **Apache OpenDALâ„¢** of the name for any individual usage (webpage, handout, slides, etc.) Depending on the context and writing style, you should use the full form of the name sufficiently often to ensure that readers clearly understand the association of both the OpenDAL project and the OpenDAL software product to the ASF as the parent organization.

For more details, see the [Apache Product Name Usage Guide](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/guide).
