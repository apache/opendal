## Versioning

**Important**: Each binding has its own independent version number, which may differ from the Rust core version. This allows bindings to be released and versioned independently based on their own release cycles and compatibility requirements.

For example, while the Rust core might be at version `0.55.0`, a binding might be at version `0.47.0` or `0.49.2`. When checking for updates or compatibility, always refer to the specific binding's version rather than the core version.

## Getting Started

Every binding should provide a `README.md` file to help users get started.
The `README.md` file should contain the following sections:

* **Installation**: how to install the binding.
* **Usage**: how to use the binding.
* **Development**: how to develop the binding.
* **Testing**: how to test the binding.

You can find the `README.md` file for each binding in the corresponding folder.

Please refer to the bindings listed above or which are already released for more details.
