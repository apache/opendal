## Getting Started

Every binding should provide a `README.md` file to help users get started.
The `README.md` file should contain the following sections:

* **Installation**: how to install the binding.
* **Usage**: how to use the binding.
* **Development**: how to develop the binding.
* **Testing**: how to test the binding.

You can find the `README.md` file for each binding in the corresponding folder.

Please refer to the bindings listed above or which are already released for more details.
