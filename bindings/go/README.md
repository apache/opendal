# Apache OpenDAL™ Go Binding

opendal-go is a **Native** Go binding for Apache OpenDAL. It is built on top of `opendal-c` without CGO enabled, using [purego](https://github.com/ebitengine/purego) and libffi.

> **Note**: This binding has its own independent version number, which may differ from the Rust core version. When checking for updates or compatibility, always refer to this binding's version rather than the core version.

- [Services & configuration](https://opendal.apache.org/services)

## Installation

opendal-go requires **libffi** to be installed.

```bash
go get github.com/apache/opendal/bindings/go@latest
```

Each service is a separate companion module. Add the schemes you use, for example the in-memory service:

```bash
go get github.com/apache/opendal-go-services/memory
```

## Quickstart

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/apache/opendal-go-services/memory"
	opendal "github.com/apache/opendal/bindings/go"
)

func main() {
	op, err := opendal.NewOperator(memory.Scheme, opendal.OperatorOptions{})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer op.Close()

	if err := op.Write("hello.txt", []byte("Hello, OpenDAL!")); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	data, err := op.Read("hello.txt")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Read content: %s\n", data)
}
```
