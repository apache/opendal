    The Getting Started example for the Lua binding, embedded into the website
    guide. It runs against the in-memory service with no credentials, so CI can
    execute it directly. The region between the ANCHOR markers is what the docs
    show — keep it copy-pasteable.

-- Create an operator against the in-memory service — no credentials needed.
-- Wrap in pcall because mlua raises errors as Lua errors, not (val, err) tuples.
local ok, op = pcall(opendal.operator.new, "memory", {})
if not ok then
    print("failed to create operator:", op)

-- Write a string to a path.
local ok, err = pcall(function() op:write("hello.txt", "Hello, World!") end)
if not ok then

    os.exit(1)

-- Read it back. Returns the content as a Lua string on success.
