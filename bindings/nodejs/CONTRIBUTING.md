## Setup

Building `nodejs` bindings requires some extra setup.

For small or first-time contributions, we recommend the dev container method. Prefer to do it yourself? That's fine too!

### Using a dev container environment

OpenDAL provides a pre-configured [dev container](https://containers.dev/) that could be used in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/), [JuptyerLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Please pick up your favourite runtime environment.

The fastest way is:

### Bring your own toolbox

The `nodejs` binding requires `Node.js@16+` to be built. We recommend using the latest TLS version for development.

OpenDAL provides a `.node-version` file that specifies the recommended node versions. You can use any compatible tool to install the correct node version, such as [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).

Alternatively, you can manually install the LTS node by following these steps:

For Ubuntu and Debian:

```shell
> curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

For RHEL, CentOS, CloudLinux, Amazon Linux or Fedora:

```shell
> curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo bash -
```

Afterward, you will need to enable `corepack` to ensure that `pnpm` has been set up correctly:

```shell
> sudo corepack enable
```

To verify that everything is working properly, run `pnpm --version`:

```shell
> pnpm --version
8.11.0
```

## Build

```bash
# Install dependencies.
> pnpm install
# Build from source.
> pnpm build
# Build from source with debug info.
> pnpm build:debug
```

## Test

We are using our own developed behavior testing framework.
Taking 'service-memory' as an example, you can use the following command to run it.

```bash
> OPENDAL_TEST=memory pnpm test
