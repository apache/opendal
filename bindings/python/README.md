This package provides a native Python binding for **Apache OpenDAL™**, a data access
layer that allows you to access various storage services in a unified way.

![OpenDAL Python Usage Demo](https://github.com/apache/opendal/assets/5351546/87bbf6e5-f19e-449a-b368-3e283016c887)

We release the OpenDAL Python binding independently of the
[`opendal` crate](https://crates.io/crates/opendal) (Rust core). For updates
and compatibility, use the Python binding version instead of the `opendal` crate
version.

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install opendal
```

Or install from [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opendal):

```bash
conda install conda-forge::opendal
```

## Quickstart

```python
import opendal

# Configure a service, then build an operator from it.
op = opendal.Operator("fs", root="/tmp")

# The same verbs work on every service.
op.write("test.txt", b"Hello World")
print(op.read("test.txt"))
print(op.stat("test.txt").content_length)
```

To use a real backend, change the scheme and pass its configuration — the
operations stay identical:

```python
op = opendal.Operator("s3", bucket="your_bucket", region="your_region")
```

OpenDAL also has a first-class async API via `opendal.AsyncOperator`. See
[Getting started](https://opendal.apache.org/docs/bindings/python/getting-started)
and [Connecting to your storage](https://opendal.apache.org/docs/bindings/python/connecting)
for the full guide.
