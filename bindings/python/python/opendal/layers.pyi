    All operators wrapped by this layer will share a common semaphore. This

    A layer that guesses MIME types for objects based on their paths or content.

    This layer uses the `mime_guess` crate

    ``Content-Type``.

    Notes
    -----
    This layer will not override a ``Content-Type`` that has already
    been set, either manually or by the backend service. It is only
    applied if no content type is present.

    A ``Content-Type`` is not guaranteed. If the file extension is

    A layer that retries operations that fail with temporary errors.

    Operations are retried if they fail with an error for which

    Notes
    -----
    After an operation on a `Reader` or `Writer` has failed through
    all retries, the object is in an undefined state. Reusing it
