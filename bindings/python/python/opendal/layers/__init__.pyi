class ConcurrentLimitLayer(Layer):
    r"""
    A layer that limits the number of concurrent operations.

    Notes
    -----
    All operators wrapped by this layer will share a common semaphore. This
    allows you to reuse the same layer across multiple operators, ensuring
    that the total number of concurrent requests across the entire
    application does not exceed the limit.
    """

    def __new__(cls, limit: builtins.int) -> ConcurrentLimitLayer:
        r"""
        Create a new ConcurrentLimitLayer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        limit : int
            Maximum number of concurrent operations allowed.

        Returns
        -------

@typing.final
class MimeGuessLayer(Layer):
    r"""
    A layer that guesses MIME types for objects based on their paths or content.

    This layer uses the `mime_guess` crate
    (see https://crates.io/crates/mime_guess) to infer the
    ``Content-Type``.

    Notes
    -----
    This layer will not override a ``Content-Type`` that has already
    been set, either manually or by the backend service. It is only
    applied if no content type is present.

    A ``Content-Type`` is not guaranteed. If the file extension is
    uncommon or unknown, the content type will remain unset.

    def __new__(cls) -> MimeGuessLayer:

        MimeGuessLayer

@typing.final
class RetryLayer(Layer):
    r"""
    A layer that retries operations that fail with temporary errors.

    Operations are retried if they fail with an error for which
    `Error.is_temporary` returns `True`. If all retries are exhausted,
    the error is marked as persistent and then returned.

    Notes
    -----
    After an operation on a `Reader` or `Writer` has failed through
    all retries, the object is in an undefined state. Reusing it
    can lead to exceptions.
