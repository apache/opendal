/// Use OpenDAL in blocking context.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// blocking::Operator is a wrapper around [`AsyncOperator`]. It calls async runtimes' `block_on` API to spawn blocking tasks.
/// Please avoid using blocking::Operator in async context.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Init in async context
///
/// blocking::Operator will use current async context's runtime to handle the async calls.
///
/// This is just for initialization. You must use `blocking::Operator` in blocking context.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use opendal::services;
/// # use opendal::blocking;
/// # use opendal::Operator;
/// # use opendal::Result;
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() -> Result<()> {
///     // Create fs backend builder.
///     let mut builder = services::S3::default().bucket("test").region("us-east-1");
///     let op = Operator::new(builder)?.finish();
///
///     // Build an `blocking::Operator` with blocking layer to start operating the storage.
///     let _: blocking::Operator = blocking::Operator::new(op)?;
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## In async context with blocking functions
///
/// If `blocking::Operator` is called in blocking function, please fetch a [`tokio::runtime::EnterGuard`]
/// first. You can use [`Handle::try_current`] first to get the handle and then call [`Handle::enter`].
/// This often happens in the case that async function calls blocking function.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use opendal::services;
/// # use opendal::blocking;
/// # use opendal::Operator;
/// # use opendal::Result;
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() -> Result<()> {
///     let _ = blocking_fn()?;
///     Ok(())
/// }
///
/// fn blocking_fn() -> Result<blocking::Operator> {
///     // Create fs backend builder.
///     let mut builder = services::S3::default().bucket("test").region("us-east-1");
///     let op = Operator::new(builder)?.finish();
///
///     let handle = tokio::runtime::Handle::try_current().unwrap();
///     let _guard = handle.enter();
///     // Build an `blocking::Operator` to start operating the storage.
///     let op: blocking::Operator = blocking::Operator::new(op)?;
///     Ok(op)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## In blocking context
///
/// In a pure blocking context, we can create a runtime and use it to create the `blocking::Operator`.
///
/// > The following code uses a global statically created runtime as an example, please manage the
/// > runtime on demand.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use std::sync::LazyLock;
/// # use opendal::services;
/// # use opendal::blocking;
/// # use opendal::Operator;
/// # use opendal::Result;
///
/// static RUNTIME: LazyLock<tokio::runtime::Runtime> = LazyLock::new(|| {
///     tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
///         .enable_all()
///         .build()
///         .unwrap()
/// });
///
/// fn main() -> Result<()> {
///     // Create fs backend builder.
///     let mut builder = services::S3::default().bucket("test").region("us-east-1");
///     let op = Operator::new(builder)?.finish();
///
///     // Fetch the `EnterGuard` from global runtime.
///     let _guard = RUNTIME.enter();
