## Capabilities

Depending on its configuration and the backing system, this service can expose:

- [ ] create_dir
- [x] stat
- [x] read
- [x] write
- [x] delete
- [x] list
- [x] copy
- [ ] rename
- [x] presign

Inspect the effective capability set with [`opendal_core::Operator::info`] and
[`opendal_core::OperatorInfo::capability`] after building an operator.

## Configuration

Use [`crate::CosConfig`] for serializable configuration and this builder's
methods for direct construction. The field and method documentation defines
accepted values, defaults, and environment interaction.

## Example

### Via Builder

```rust,no_run
use opendal_core::Operator;
use opendal_core::Result;
use opendal_service_cos::Cos;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // create backend builder
    let mut builder = Cos::default()
        // set the storage bucket for OpenDAL
        .bucket("test")
        // set the endpoint for OpenDAL
        .endpoint("https://cos.ap-singapore.myqcloud.com")
        // Set the access_key_id and secret_access_key.
        //
        // OpenDAL will try load credential from the env.
        // If credential not set and no valid credential in env, OpenDAL will
        // send request without signing like anonymous user.
        .secret_id("secret_id")
        .secret_key("secret_access_key");

    let op: Operator = Operator::new(builder)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Restore

Restore requires a bucket with versioning enabled and permission to list object
versions, delete specific versions, and copy objects. `Operator::restore` removes
the current delete marker, or succeeds without changing an already-live object.
Each call removes only one current marker; repeated deletions can require repeated
restore calls. An unknown path returns `NotFound`.

`Operator::restore_with(...).version(...)` copies the selected historical version
to the same path as a new current version. Conditional restore with
`if_not_exists` is not supported.

COS version listings can briefly retain a deleted marker. If the listed marker
no longer exists, restore returns a temporary error rather than reporting that
another deletion was restored. Use `RetryLayer` to retry after the listing updates.
