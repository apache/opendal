/// `GoosefsWriter` implements [`oio::Write`] on top of the goosefs-sdk
/// high-level streaming writer (`GoosefsFileWriter`).
///
/// # Write-via-temp protocol
///
/// To keep in-flight writes from being visible — and to make `abort()`
/// truly leave no trace — every write first streams into a sibling
/// temporary path, and is then renamed onto the caller's target in a
/// single metadata RPC on `close()`:
///
/// 1.  **open**: on the very first `write()` / `close()` call, we pick
///     a temporary path of the form
///     `"{dir}/.opendal.tmp.{pid}.{counter}.{nanos}.{basename}"`. The
///     temp name is intentionally produced in the **same parent
///     directory** as the final target so we stay on the same UFS
///     mount — this keeps the final `rename` a pure metadata op on
///     GooseFS and avoids a cross-filesystem data copy.
/// 2.  **stream**: bytes are written block-by-block into the temp path
///     via `GoosefsFileWriter`. We iterate over the incoming `Buffer`
///     chunks directly instead of flattening them with `to_bytes()`,
///     so multi-segment buffers don't force an extra concat copy.
/// 3.  **finalize**: `close()` calls `GoosefsFileWriter::close()` (which
///     commits the temp file on the master), then removes any
///     pre-existing object at the final path (overwrite) or returns
///     `ConditionNotMatch` (if-not-exists), and finally
///     `rename(temp, final)`.
/// 4.  **abort**: `abort()` cancels the in-flight SDK writer (which
///     drops any blocks already staged on workers) and removes the
///     temp inode on the master. The final target is never touched
///     in the abort path — by construction we haven't published
///     anything there yet.
///
/// This avoids the old failure mode where an interrupted write could
/// leave a half-written blob at the caller's final path, and it makes
/// overwrite vs if-not-exists decisions race only against concurrent
/// *metadata* mutations on the final path (a small, bounded window
/// around the `rename`).
///
/// # Why check if-not-exists twice
///
/// We check `if_not_exists` both up front (before opening the SDK
/// writer, so we don't waste bytes on a temp that will never be
/// finalized) and again at finalize time (because another writer may
/// have created the object while we were streaming). The second
/// check is what actually enforces the contract; the first is a
/// best-effort fast-path optimisation.
