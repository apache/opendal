//! Apache OpenDALâ„¢ is a data access layer that allows users to easily and
//! efficiently retrieve data from various storage services in a unified way.
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! OpenDAL's API entry points are [`Operator`] and [`BlockingOperator`]. All
//! public APIs are accessible through the operator. To utilize OpenDAL, you
//! need to:
//!
//! - [Init a service](#init-a-service)
//! - [Compose layers](#compose-layers)
//! - [Use operator](#use-operator)
//!
//! ## Init a service
//!
//! The first step is to pick a service and init it with a builder. All supported
//! services could be found at [`services`].
//!
//! Let's take [`services::S3`] as an example:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use opendal::services;
//! use opendal::Operator;
//! use opendal::Result;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     // Pick a builder and configure it.
//!     let mut builder = services::S3::default();
//!     builder.bucket("test");
//!
//!     // Init an operator
//!     let op = Operator::new(builder)?.finish();
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Compose layers
//!
//! The next setup is to compose layers. Layers are modules that provide extra
//! features for every operation. All builtin layers could be found at [`layers`].
//!
//! Let's use [`layers::LoggingLayer`] as an example; this layer adds logging to
//! every operation that OpenDAL performs.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use opendal::layers::LoggingLayer;
//! use opendal::services;
//! use opendal::Operator;
//! use opendal::Result;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     // Pick a builder and configure it.
//!     let mut builder = services::S3::default();
//!     builder.bucket("test");
//!
//!     // Init an operator
//!     let op = Operator::new(builder)?
//!         // Init with logging layer enabled.
//!         .layer(LoggingLayer::default())
//!         .finish();
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Use operator
//!
//! The final step is to use the operator. OpenDAL supports both async [`Operator`]
//! and blocking [`BlockingOperator`]. Please pick the one that fits your use case.
//!
//! Every Operator API follows the same pattern, take `read` as an example:
//!
//! - `read`: Execute a read operation.
//! - `read_with`: Execute a read operation with additional options, like `range` and `if_match`.
//! - `reader`: Create a reader for streaming data, enabling flexible access.
//! - `reader_with`: Create a reader with advanced options.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use opendal::layers::LoggingLayer;
//! use opendal::services;
//! use opendal::Operator;
//! use opendal::Result;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     // Pick a builder and configure it.
//!     let mut builder = services::S3::default();
//!     builder.bucket("test");
//!
//!     // Init an operator
//!     let op = Operator::new(builder)?
//!         // Init with logging layer enabled.
//!         .layer(LoggingLayer::default())
//!         .finish();
//!
//!     // Fetch this file's metadata
//!     let meta = op.stat("hello.txt").await?;
//!     let length = meta.content_length();
//!
//!     // Read data from `hello.txt` with range `0..1024`.
//!     let bs = op.read_with("hello.txt").range(0..1024).await?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```

// Make sure all our public APIs have docs.
