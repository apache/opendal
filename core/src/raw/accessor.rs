/// The actual data access of storage service happens in Accessor layer.
/// Every storage supported by OpenDAL must implement [`Access`] but not all
/// methods of [`Access`] will be implemented according to how the storage service is.
///
/// For example, user can not modify the content from one HTTP file server directly.
/// So [`Http`][crate::services::Http] implements and provides only read related actions.
///
/// [`Access`] gives default implementation for all methods which will raise [`ErrorKind::Unsupported`] error.
/// And what action this [`Access`] supports will be pointed out in [`AccessorInfo`].
///
/// # Note
///
/// Visit [`internals`][crate::docs::internals] for more tutorials.
///
/// # Operations
///
/// - Path in args will all be normalized into the same style, services
///   should handle them based on services' requirement.
///   - Path that ends with `/` means it's Dir, otherwise, it's File.
///   - Root dir is `/`
///   - Path will never be empty.
/// - Operations without capability requirement like `metadata`, `create` are
///   basic operations.
///   - All services must implement them.
///   - Use `unimplemented!()` if not implemented or can't implement.
/// - Operations with capability requirement like `presign` are optional operations.
///   - Services can implement them based on services capabilities.
///   - The default implementation should return [`ErrorKind::Unsupported`].
