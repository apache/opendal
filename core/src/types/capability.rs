/// Capability defines the supported operations and their constraints for a storage Operator.
///
/// # Overview
///
/// This structure provides a comprehensive description of an Operator's capabilities,
/// including:
///
/// - Basic operations support (read, write, delete, etc.)
/// - Advanced operation variants (conditional operations, metadata handling)
/// - Operational constraints (size limits, batch limitations)
///
/// # Capability Types
///
/// Every operator maintains two capability sets:
///
/// 1. [`OperatorInfo::native_capability`][crate::OperatorInfo::native_capability]:
///    Represents operations natively supported by the storage backend.
///
/// 2. [`OperatorInfo::full_capability`][crate::OperatorInfo::full_capability]:
///    Represents all available operations, including those implemented through
///    alternative mechanisms.
///
/// # Implementation Details
///
/// Some operations might be available even when not natively supported by the
/// backend. For example:
///
/// - Blocking operations are provided through the BlockingLayer
///
/// Developers should:
/// - Use `full_capability` to determine available operations
/// - Use `native_capability` to identify optimized operations
///
/// # Field Naming Conventions
///
/// Fields follow these naming patterns:
///
/// - Basic operations: Simple lowercase (e.g., `read`, `write`)
/// - Compound operations: Underscore-separated (e.g., `presign_read`)
/// - Variants: Capability description (e.g., `write_can_empty`)
/// - Parameterized operations: With-style (e.g., `read_with_if_match`)
/// - Limitations: Constraint description (e.g., `write_multi_max_size`)
/// - Metadata Results: Returning metadata capabilities (e.g., `stat_has_content_length`)
///
/// All capability fields are public and can be accessed directly.
