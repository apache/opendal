# Default GooseFS launcher for OpenDAL CI / local dev.
#
# The stock `goosefs.tencentcloudcr.com/goosefs/repo:v2.1.0` entrypoint
# (`goosefs-start.sh local`) starts *five* JVMs: master, worker,
# job_master, job_worker and table_master. On the GitHub Actions
# ubuntu-latest runner, the three processes OpenDAL does NOT use
# (job_master + job_worker + table_master) still consume ~1.1 GiB RSS
# and an extra ~10-15s of start-up CPU. During the caller's 3-4 minute
# `cargo build` / `dotnet test-compile` window these extra JVMs can
# starve the worker of CPU, which has been empirically correlated with
# the `tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 111)` failures
# we see on `127.0.0.1:9203` at data-plane write time.
#
# OpenDAL's goosefs service (see `core/services/goosefs/src/core.rs`)
# only talks to:
#   * master RPC on 9200  -- metadata (mkdir / ls / stat / rm)
#   * worker RPC on 9203  -- block I/O
#
# job_master / job_worker drive distributed copy / async persist / cross
# mount, and table_master backs Hive-style catalogs. None of those paths
# are exercised by OpenDAL. Dropping them halves the fixture's memory
# footprint (observed: 978 MiB vs. ~1.9 GiB for `local`) while keeping
# the externally visible behaviour identical.
#
# The script is structured so it can safely replace the image's default
# entrypoint (`docker-entrypoint.sh local`):
#
#   1. Apply the same `goosefs-site.properties` overrides that the image
#      entrypoint applies (bind hosts, worker/master hostnames).
#   2. Create the runtime directories the image expects to exist.
#   3. Format the journal on first boot (journal dir empty) -- exactly
#      what `docker-entrypoint.sh format_if_needed` does.
#   4. Launch `goosefs-start.sh -a master` and
#      `goosefs-start.sh -a worker NoMount` (the `-a` flag tells the
#      launcher to return asynchronously; each component is started as
#      a detached daemon writing to /opt/goosefs/logs/).
#   5. `exec tail -F` on the two log files so the container stays alive
#      and `docker logs` shows the running state. When either JVM dies,
#      its log tail surfaces in `docker logs` and the compose healthcheck
#      (a real data-plane probe) will fail.
#
# Re-exec-safe: every step tolerates already-existing state, so the
# script can be restarted (e.g. by compose's `restart: on-failure`).

# Force the JVM (master/worker/goosefs CLI) to resolve `localhost` to
# 127.0.0.1 instead of ::1. On Ubuntu 24.04 GitHub Actions runners the
# default JDK resolves `localhost` to ::1 first, so the master binds
# 9200/9212/9202 on ::1 while the worker / `fs` CLI dials 127.0.0.1 ->
# `Connection refused`, looping on `Failed to connect to ... :9212`
# until the compose healthcheck times out. Pinning the stack to IPv4
# keeps bind and dial on the same family without touching the host
# kernel.

# Use the IPv4 literal `127.0.0.1` (not the name `localhost`) for the
# master hostname on purpose. The master's *client-facing* RPC port
# 9200 is bound directly to whatever `goosefs.master.hostname` resolves
# to (there is no separate `goosefs.master.client.rpc.bind.host` in
# GooseFS 2.x). On Ubuntu 24.04 GitHub Actions runners and many Linux
# images, `/etc/hosts` resolves `localhost` to BOTH `::1` and
# `127.0.0.1`, and the JVM's default resolver may hand back `::1`
# first — even with `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`, because that
# flag only suppresses *creating* IPv6 sockets, it does not change
# `InetAddress.getByName("localhost")`'s ordering when the name maps
# to both families. Result: master binds 9200 on `[::1]`, while the
# in-container worker (and the `fs` CLI used by the healthcheck) dials
# `127.0.0.1:9200` over IPv4 and gets `Connection refused` in a tight
# retry loop, never registers, and the data-plane healthcheck times
# out. Pinning the hostname to the v4 literal forces bind+dial onto
# the same loopback address and matches what `GOOSEFS_WORKER_HOSTNAME`
# already does for the worker side.
