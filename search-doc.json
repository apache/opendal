If I were to indicate the position of OpenDAL, I would say it is at the end of the Innovators stage and moving toward the Early Adopters stage.  (picture from TechTarget technology adoption lifecycle)  Innovators are adopting OpenDAL. Projects like Databend, RisingWave, GreptimeDB, and sccache have been using OpenDAL in production for years. However, early adopters are still hesitant to use OpenDAL—and they have valid reasons.  For examples:  OpenDAL hasn't reached version 1.0 yet and still introduces breaking changes from time to time, sometimes even requiring code modifications for an OpenDAL upgrade. This also creates a burden for libraries that depend on OpenDAL, as every breaking change affects them as well.OpenDAL lacks comprehensive documentation, particularly for its bindings in Python and Java. Users need to invest significant effort and love to integrate OpenDAL bindings into their projects.OpenDAL lacks some important features, such as checksum support, caching, metrics of underlying http requests and initialization from a URI.

Its goal is to make signing API requests simple. Many APIs look straightforward, but they quickly become complicated once hidden behind complex abstractions.  One major challenge is authentication. For example, AWS V4 requires users to build a signature from the request and sign it using HMAC with a secret key. Another challenge is credential loading. Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP support various types of credentials and loading methods to balance security and ease of use.  All these features together make simple APIs feel complex. To send a single GetObject call, you often need to rely on many AWS crates and go through deep abstraction layers.  Reqsign's goal is to bring simplicity back: build, sign, send.  In general, Reqsign provides three main parts for different services:  ProvideCredential: Lets users provide credentials in different ways such as environment variables, profiles, IMDS, OIDC, and more. Reqsign also provides a default chain for every service so it works out of the box without extra configuration.SignRequest: Implements the signing logic so that requests are correctly signed with the given provider credentials.Context: Offers a pluggable context mechanism that supports HTTP send, command execution, and environment access. This allows users to configure the runtime context as they wish and makes Reqsign available in WASM.  For example:  use anyhow::Result; use reqsign::aws; #[tokio::main] async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; { // Create a default signer for S3 in us-east-1 // // This will automatically: // - Load credentials from environment variables, config files, or IAM roles // - Set up the default HTTP client and file reader let signer = aws::default_signer(&quot;s3&quot;, &quot;us-east-1&quot;); // Build your request let mut req = http::Request::builder() .method(&quot;GET&quot;) .uri(&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/testbucket&quot;) .body(()) .unwrap() .into_parts() .0; // Sign the request signer.sign(&amp;mut req, None).await?; // Send the request with your preferred HTTP client println!(&quot;Request has been signed!&quot;); Ok(()) }   Currently, Reqsign supports Aliyun OSS, AWS V4, Azure Storage, Google, Huawei Cloud OBS, Oracle, and Tencent COS.

We've found, however, that this led to significant duplication between append and write. As a result, we've streamlined the two functionalities into a single write function. Our users can now:  let mut w = op.writer_with(&quot;test.txt&quot;).append(true).await?; w.write(content_a).await?; w.write(content_b).await?; w.close().await?;   This way, users can reuse the Writer in their own logic without handling append separately.  New Lister API​  To improve API consistency, we've made some adjustments to our listing functions. We've added list and list_with methods that perform single operations and renamed the original list to lister and lister_with.  // Old API let lister: Lister = op.list(&quot;dir&quot;).await?; // New API let entries: Vec&lt;Entry&gt; = op.list(&quot;dir&quot;).await?; let lister: Lister = op.lister(&quot;dir&quot;).await?;   This brings uniformity to our API offerings.  List With Metakey​  To speed up list operations, OpenDAL can now fetch and store metadata during the listing process. This eliminates the need for separate metadata calls:  let entries: Vec&lt;Entry&gt; = op .list_with(&quot;dir/&quot;) .metakey(Metakey::ContentLength | Metakey::ContentType).await?; // Use the metadata directly! let meta: &amp;Metadata = entries[0].metadata();   This makes metadata retrieval more intuitive.

OpenDAL is an Apache Incubator project aimed at helping users access data from various storage services in a unified, convenient, and efficient way. Its project vision is &quot;free access to data&quot;:  Free from services: Any service can be accessed freely through native interfacesFree from implementations: No matter how the underlying implementation is, it can be called in a unified wayFree to integrate: Able to freely integrate with various services and languagesFree to zero cost: Users don't have to pay for features they don't use  On this philosophical foundation, OpenDAL Rust Core can be mainly divided into the following components:  Operator: The outer interface exposed to usersLayers: Specific implementation of different middlewareServices: Specific implementation of different services  From a macroscopic perspective, OpenDAL's data reading call stack would look like this:    All Layers and Services have implemented a unified Accessor interface, erasing all type information when building the Operator. For the Operator, regardless of what services are used or how many middleware are added, all call logic is consistent. This design splits OpenDAL's API into Public API and Raw API, where the Public API is directly exposed to users, providing convenient top-level interfaces, and Raw API is provided to OpenDAL internal developers, maintaining a unified internal interface and providing some convenient implementation.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Operator​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Apache OpenDAL™ Internal: Data Reading","url":"/blog/how-opendal-read-data/#operator","content":" OpenDAL's Operator API will adhere to a consistent calling paradigm as much as possible, reducing users' learning and usage costs. For example, OpenDAL offers the following APIs for read:  op.read(path): Reads the entire content of the specified fileop.reader(path): Creates a Reader for streaming readingop.read_with(path).range(1..1024): Reads file content using specified parameters, such as rangeop.reader_with(path).range(1..1024): Creates a Reader for streaming reading with specified parameters  It's not hard to see that read is more like syntactic sugar, allowing users to quickly read files without considering various traits like AsyncRead. The reader provides more flexibility, implementing widely-used community traits like AsyncSeek, AsyncRead, allowing more flexible data reading. read_with and reader_with assist users in specifying various parameters in a more natural way through Future Builder functions.  The internal logic of the Operator would look like this:    Its main job is to encapsulate the interface for the user:  Completing the construction of OpRead: the args for read operation.Calling the read function provided by AccessorWrapping the returned value as Reader and implementing interfaces like AsyncSeek, AsyncRead, etc., based on Reader  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Layers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Apache OpenDAL™ Internal: Data Reading","url":"/blog/how-opendal-read-data/#layers","content":" A little secret here is that OpenDAL will automatically apply some Layers to the Service to implement some internal logic. As of the completion of this article, OpenDAL's automatically added Layers include:  ErrorContextLayer: Injects context information, such as scheme, path, etc., into all returned errors of OperationCompleteLayer: Adds necessary capabilities to services, such as adding seek support to s3TypeEraseLayer: Implements type erasure, uniformly erasing associated types in Accessor, so users don't need to carry generic parameters when using it  Here, ErrorContextLayer and TypeEraseLayer are relatively simple and won't be elaborated on. The focus is on CompleteLayer, aimed at adding seek or next support to OpenDAL's returned Reader in a zero-cost way, so users don't have to re-implement it. OpenDAL initially returned Reader and SeekableReader through different function calls in early versions, but the actual user feedback was not very good; almost all users were using SeekableReader. Therefore, OpenDAL subsequently added seek support as the first priority to the internal Read trait during the refactor:  pub trait Read: Unpin + Send + Sync { /// Read bytes asynchronously. fn poll_read(&amp;mut self, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;, buf: &amp;mut [u8]) -&gt; Poll&lt;Result&lt;usize&gt;&gt;; /// Seek asynchronously. /// /// Returns `Unsupported` error if underlying reader doesn't support seek. fn poll_seek(&amp;mut self, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;, pos: io::SeekFrom) -&gt; Poll&lt;Result&lt;u64&gt;&gt;; /// Stream [`Bytes`] from underlying reader. /// /// Returns `Unsupported` error if underlying reader doesn't support stream. /// /// This API exists for avoiding bytes copying inside async runtime. /// Users can poll bytes from underlying reader and decide when to /// read/consume them. fn poll_next(&amp;mut self, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Result&lt;Bytes&gt;&gt;&gt;; }   To implement a service's reading capability in OpenDAL, one needs to implement this trait, which is an internal interface and will not be directly exposed to users. Among them:  poll_read is the most basic requirement; all services must implement this interface.When the service natively supports seek, poll_seek can be implemented, and OpenDAL will correctly dispatch, such as local fs;When the service natively supports next, meaning it returns streaming Bytes, poll_next can be implemented, like HTTP-based services, where the underlying layer is a TCP Stream, and hyper will encapsulate it as a bytes stream.  Through the Read trait, OpenDAL ensures that all services can expose their native support capabilities as much as possible, thereby achieving efficient reading for different services.  Based on this trait, OpenDAL will complete according to the capabilities supported by each service:  Both seek/next are supported: Direct returnNo support for next: Encapsulate using StreamableReader to simulate next supportNo support for seek: Encapsulate using ByRangeSeekableReader to simulate seek supportNeither seek/next supported: Encapsulate using both methods  ByRangeSeekableReader mainly utilizes the service's ability to support range read, dropping the current reader when the user seeks and initiating a new request at the specified location.  OpenDAL exposes a unified Reader implementation through CompleteLayer, so users don't have to worry about whether the underlying service supports seek; OpenDAL will always choose the optimal way to initiate the request.

Using async_compat::Compat, we have transformed it into futures::AsyncRead and futures::AsyncSeek. Based on this, we provide a built-in function oio::into_read_from_file to transform it into a type that implements oio::Read.  There's nothing particularly complex in the implementation of oio::into_read_from_file; read and seek are mostly calling the functions provided by the incoming File type. The tricky part is about the correct handling of seek and range: seeking to the right side of the range is allowed, and this will not cause an error, and reading will only return empty, but seeking to the left side of the range is illegal, and the Reader must return InvalidInput for proper upper-level handling.  Interesting history: there was an issue in the initial implementation of this part, discovered during fuzz testing.

Here's an extra note about a small pitfall with reqwest/hyper: reqwest and hyper do not check the returned content length, so an illegal server may return a data volume that does not match the expected content length instead of an error, leading to unexpected data behavior. OpenDAL specifically added checks here, returning ContentIncomplete when data is insufficient and ContentTruncated when data exceeds expectations, avoiding users receiving illegal data.

Being a committer does not require you to participate any more than you already do. It does tend to make one even more committed. You will probably find that you spend more time here.
