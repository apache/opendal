# Apache OpenDAL Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```
$ pnpm install
```

## Local Development

```
$ pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## LLM documentation

CI generates the Rust LLM supplement in the Rust documentation job, using the same toolchain, installed native dependencies, and Cargo target directory as the API documentation build. Cargo replaces the crate's HTML output when generating JSON, so CI uploads the HTML first, then uploads `llms.json` separately as `rust-llms-documentation`. The website downloads both artifacts and reuses the supplement for every deployment variant. Missing, invalid, or empty configured artifacts fail the build.

Local website builds do not invoke Cargo. To include Rust content, download the `rust-llms-documentation` artifact from a successful Docs workflow and point the website at its `llms.json` file:

```bash
OPENDAL_RUSTDOC_LLMS=/tmp/opendal-rust-llms/llms.json pnpm build
```

Leave `OPENDAL_RUSTDOC_LLMS` unset to build only the website's LLM content.

## Images and badges

Website images are resolved locally by `plugins/local-images.js`. The resolver runs before Markdown compilation and on the generated API documentation, so client navigation and standalone API pages use the same resources. It does not download images during a build.

- Shared README and rustdoc sources use `https://opendal.apache.org/img/` URLs for project images. The website resolves them to files in `static/img/`, with the current website base URL.
- Badges are generated as self-contained SVG data URLs. Version badges show the version of the documented Rust, Node.js, or Ruby package, read from that package's manifest. CI, package-download, and Discord badges are fixed links rather than live metrics.
- Unknown external images fail the build with their page and URL. Add a local asset or an explicit badge presentation to the resolver instead of adding a network fallback.

Run `pnpm test` to check image paths in API HTML, independent package versions, and errors for unknown external images. To test a nested deployment path, run `OPENDAL_WEBSITE_BASE_URL=/opendal/opendal-docs-stable/ pnpm build`.

Since search plugin can not work with `pnpm start`, for testing please run `pnpm build && pnpm serve`.
