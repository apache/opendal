# Apache OpenDAL™ Rust Core

`opendal` is the Rust core that every OpenDAL binding is built on. It is the
most complete and most mature surface of the project: every service, every
layer, and the full async API live here first.

New to the model behind the API? Read [Concepts](../03-concepts.mdx) first —
service, operator, layer, operation are the same four ideas in every language.

## Status

Stable and production-ready. The crate follows semver; breaking changes are
batched into minor releases and documented in the [Upgrade Guide].

## Capabilities

- **Async-first**, with an optional [blocking API](./02-getting-started.md#blocking-vs-async).
- **Streaming** reads and writes for data that does not fit in memory.
- **50+ services** behind one API — see [Services](/services) for the full list
  and per-service configuration.
- **Composable layers** for retry, logging, timeout, and metrics — see
  [Going to production](./05-production.md).
- **Presigned URLs** for services that support them (S3, GCS, Azblob, …).

## Installation

```shell
cargo add opendal
```

OpenDAL is modular: each service is its own feature flag. The in-memory service
is always available; enable any other service — including `fs` — with its
`services-*` feature.

```toml
[dependencies]
opendal = { version = "0.57", features = ["services-s3"] }
```

## Next steps

1. [Getting started](./02-getting-started.md) — a runnable program, then a real backend.
2. [Connecting to your storage](./03-connecting.md) — build an operator for any service.
3. [Common tasks](./04-tasks.md) — read, write, stream, list, presign, and more.
4. [Going to production](./05-production.md) — retry, timeouts, errors, observability.
