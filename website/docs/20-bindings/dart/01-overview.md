# Apache OpenDAL™ Dart Binding

A Dart binding for OpenDAL: access S3, GCS, Azure Blob, the local filesystem,
and [50+ more services](/services) through one API, backed by the Rust core via
[flutter_rust_bridge](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge).

The API follows the `dart:io` stdlib style — `Storage`, `File`, and `Directory`
objects that should feel familiar to any Dart developer.

New to the model behind the API? Read [Concepts](../../03-concepts.mdx) first —
service, operator, layer, and operation are the same four ideas in every language.

:::caution Experimental
This binding is a work in progress. The public API may change between releases.
It is not yet published to pub.dev. Expect rough edges and missing features
compared to the Rust core or the Python binding.
:::

## Capabilities

- **Async and sync** — every `File` and `Directory` method has both an `async`
  (`Future<T>`) and a blocking (`*Sync`) variant.
- **File operations** — `read`, `write`, `exists`, `stat`, `delete`, `rename`.
- **Directory operations** — `create`, `exists`, `stat`, `delete`, `rename`.
- **stdlib-style API** — `Storage.initFile()` and `Storage.initDir()` return
  factory functions that mirror `dart:io`.

The binding currently exposes read, write, stat, exists, delete, rename, and
createDir. Listing, copy, and presigned URLs are not yet surfaced.

## Installation

This binding is not yet published to pub.dev. Add it as a path dependency from
the repository, or build it from source following the
[Development guide](https://github.com/apache/opendal/tree/main/bindings/dart#development).

The native Rust library must be compiled separately:

```shell
cd bindings/dart/rust
cargo build -r
```
