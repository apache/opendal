description: Build an OpenDAL operator in .NET for any backend — scheme + dictionary, typed config, and credentials.

# Connecting to your storage

Switching backends is a configuration change, not a code change. For the
configuration keys of a specific service, see [Services](/services).

The binding bundles every service — there are no build flags. Once the binding
is referenced, every backend is available.

## Build an operator

### From a scheme and dictionary

The first argument is the service scheme; configuration follows as a
`Dictionary<string, string>` whose keys match the service's configuration fields:

```csharp
using OpenDAL;

using var op = new Operator("s3", new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    ["bucket"] = "my-bucket",
    ["region"] = "us-east-1",
    ["endpoint"] = "https://s3.amazonaws.com",
});
```

A local filesystem operator roots every path under one directory:

```csharp
using var fs = new Operator("fs", new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    ["root"] = "/tmp/opendal",
});
```

### From a typed service config

Each service also has a strongly typed config class in `OpenDAL.ServiceConfig`.
It is converted to the same key/value options internally, so the result is
identical — pick this form for compile-time-checked, discoverable properties:

```csharp
using OpenDAL;
using OpenDAL.ServiceConfig;

using var fs = new Operator(new FsServiceConfig
{
    Root = "/tmp/opendal",
});
```

Available scheme names and their keys are defined by OpenDAL; see the
[Scheme reference](https://docs.rs/opendal/latest/opendal/enum.Scheme.html) and
[Services](/services).

## Credentials

Credentials are just more configuration keys. Set them in the dictionary (or on
the typed config) — for example S3's `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`:

```csharp
using var op = new Operator("s3", new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    ["bucket"] = "my-bucket",
    ["region"] = "us-east-1",
    ["access_key_id"] = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")!,
    ["secret_access_key"] = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")!,
});
```

Some services also load credentials from their platform's default sources (for
S3, the standard AWS environment variables and profiles). See each service's
page under [Services](/services) for the exact keys and credential behavior.

Avoid hard-coding secrets in source. Read them from the environment or a secret
manager and pass them in when you build the operator.

## One operator per service and root

An operator maps to one service and one root path. To work with two buckets or
two roots, build two operators — they are lightweight handles. Use `Duplicate()`
to create another handle to the same backend configuration. Always dispose
operators with `using` or an explicit `Dispose()`.
