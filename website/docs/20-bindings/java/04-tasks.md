# Common tasks

Recipes for the things you actually do with storage. Each works on every
service. They assume an `Operator op` built as in
[Getting started](./02-getting-started.md). For full signatures, see the
[API reference](https://opendal.apache.org/docs/java/).

A few conventions used throughout:

- Paths are relative to the operator's root; a trailing `/` means a directory
  (`logs/app/` is a directory, `logs/app` is a file).
- `read` returns `byte[]`; `write` takes a `String` or `byte[]`.
- The synchronous `Operator` is shown here. `AsyncOperator` mirrors these verbs,
  returning a `CompletableFuture` from each call.

## Read a whole file

```java
byte[] data = op.read("path/to/file");
String text = new String(data);
```

## Read part of a file

`read(path, offset, length)` reads a range:

```java
byte[] data = op.read("path/to/file", 0, 1024);
```

For repeated reads from the same file, create an `OperatorReader`. It uses a
Rust core reader and lets each call select an independent byte range:

```java
import org.apache.opendal.OperatorReader;
import org.apache.opendal.ReaderOptions;

ReaderOptions options = ReaderOptions.builder()
        .chunk(8 * 1024 * 1024L)
        .concurrent(4)
        .prefetch(2)
        .build();
try (OperatorReader reader = op.reader("path/to/file", options)) {
    byte[] first = reader.read(0, 1024);
    byte[] next = reader.read(1024, 1024);
}
```

A positive `chunk` enables internal range requests; `concurrent` limits those
requests and `prefetch` counts completed chunks buffered ahead. Setting
`concurrent` alone keeps unchunked streaming. A reader does not snapshot the
file, so subsequent reads may observe changes.

`ReaderOptions` also supports `version`, `ifMatch`, `ifNoneMatch`,
`ifVersionMatch`, `ifVersionNotMatch`, `ifModifiedSince`, and
`ifUnmodifiedSince`. The time conditions accept `java.time.Instant`.
Version selection and conditions require service support. Unsupported options
fail with `Unsupported`; a failed condition on an existing file fails with
`ConditionNotMatch`. Conditions apply to all requests through the reader,
including its streams. Errors may surface when creating the reader
or while reading from it.

## Stream a large file

Don't load gigabytes into memory — read through an `InputStream` in chunks:

```java
import java.io.InputStream;

try (InputStream in = op.createInputStream("big.bin")) {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
    int n;
    while ((n = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
        // process buffer[0..n]
    }
}
```

For a configured reader, use `reader.createInputStream()` for the whole file
or `reader.createInputStream(offset, length)` for a range. A length of `-1`
reads to the end; zero selects an empty range. Each stream has its own cursor.
Close each reader and stream separately: closing a reader does not close its
streams, and closing the operator does not close its readers.

## Write a whole file

```java
op.write("path/to/file", "Hello, World!");
op.write("path/to/file", new byte[] {0, 1, 2, 3});
```

## Stream a large upload

Write incrementally through an `OutputStream`; closing it commits the upload:

```java
import java.io.OutputStream;

try (OutputStream out = op.createOutputStream("big.bin")) {
    out.write(firstChunk);
    out.write(secondChunk);
}
```

## Check metadata

```java
import org.apache.opendal.Metadata;

Metadata meta = op.stat("path/to/file");
System.out.println(meta.getContentLength() + " bytes, dir = " + meta.isDir());
```

## List a directory

`list` returns the entries under a path:

```java
import org.apache.opendal.Entry;

for (Entry entry : op.list("dir/")) {
    System.out.println(entry.getPath() + " " + entry.getMetadata().getMode());
}
```

## Walk a tree recursively

Pass a `ListOptions` with `recursive(true)`:

```java
import org.apache.opendal.Entry;
import org.apache.opendal.ListOptions;

ListOptions options = ListOptions.builder().recursive(true).build();
for (Entry entry : op.list("dir/", options)) {
    System.out.println(entry.getPath());
}
```

## Delete a file or a whole tree

```java
op.delete("path/to/file");   // single path; succeeds even if missing
op.removeAll("dir/");        // a path and everything under it
```

## Create a directory

```java
op.createDir("path/to/dir/");   // the trailing slash is required
```

## Copy and rename

```java
op.copy("from.txt", "to.txt");
op.rename("old.txt", "new.txt");
```

Both require a service that supports them; see
[capability checks](./05-production.md#capability-checks).

## Generate a presigned URL

Hand a time-limited URL to a third party so they can access an object without
your credentials. Presigning is part of the **async** API:

```java
import java.time.Duration;
import org.apache.opendal.AsyncOperator;
import org.apache.opendal.PresignedRequest;

try (AsyncOperator op = AsyncOperator.of("s3", conf)) {
    PresignedRequest req =
        op.presignRead("path/to/file", Duration.ofHours(1)).join();
    System.out.println(req.getMethod() + " " + req.getUri());
    System.out.println(req.getHeaders());
}
```

`presignWrite` and `presignStat` produce presigned requests for the matching
operations.
