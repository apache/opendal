# Apache OpenDAL™ Node.js Binding

A native Node.js binding for OpenDAL: access S3, GCS, Azure Blob, HDFS, the local
filesystem, and [50+ more services](/services) through one API, with the
performance of the Rust core underneath.

New to the model behind the API? Read [Concepts](../../03-concepts.mdx) first —
service, operator, layer, operation are the same four ideas in every language.

:::note
This binding has its own version number, independent of the Rust core. Check
compatibility against the binding's version, not the core's.

## Status

Released and stable, published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opendal).

## Capabilities

- **Promise-based async API** — every operation returns a `Promise`; `await` it.
- **Synchronous variants** — each verb has a `*Sync` form (`readSync`,
  `writeSync`, …) for blocking code.
- **Streaming** reads and writes via Node `Readable`/`Writable` streams for data
  that does not fit in memory.
- **All services included** — the package bundles every backend; there are no
  build flags to enable.
- **Composable layers** for retry, timeout, logging, throttle, and concurrency
  limits — see [Going to production](./05-production.md).
- **Presigned URLs** for services that support them (S3, GCS, Azblob, …).

## Installation

```shell
npm install opendal
```

## Next steps

1. [Getting started](./02-getting-started.md) — a runnable program, then a real backend.
2. [Connecting to your storage](./03-connecting.md) — build an operator for any service.
3. [Common tasks](./04-tasks.md) — read, write, stream, list, copy, and presign.
4. [Going to production](./05-production.md) — retry, timeouts, errors, observability.
