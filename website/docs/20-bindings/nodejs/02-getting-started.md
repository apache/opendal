# Getting started

## Your first program

This program builds an operator, writes a file, reads it back, inspects its
metadata, and deletes it. It runs against the in-memory service with no
credentials, so you can run it right after installing.

```shell
npm install opendal
```

```javascript
import { Operator } from "opendal";

async function main() {
  // Configure a service, then build an operator from it.
  const op = new Operator("memory");

  // The same verbs work on every service.
  await op.write("hello.txt", "Hello, World!");

  const bs = await op.read("hello.txt");        // returns a Buffer
  console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(bs));

  const meta = await op.stat("hello.txt");
  console.log(`size = ${meta.contentLength} bytes`);

  await op.delete("hello.txt");
}

main();
```

`write` accepts a `string` or a `Buffer`; `read` returns a `Buffer`. Decode it
with `new TextDecoder().decode(bs)` or `bs.toString()`.

## Point it at a real backend

Only the service changes; the operations stay identical. The scheme is the first
argument, and configuration is an options object:

```javascript
import { Operator } from "opendal";

const op = new Operator("s3", {
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  region: "us-east-1",
});

await op.write("hello.txt", "Hello from S3!");
console.log((await op.read("hello.txt")).toString());
```

The package bundles every service, so there is nothing extra to install. The next
page, [Connecting to your storage](./03-connecting.md), covers configuration and
credentials in depth; [Services](/services) lists every backend and its keys.

## Async and sync {#blocking-vs-async}

OpenDAL's Node.js API is promise-based: every operation returns a `Promise` you
`await`. For synchronous code, each verb has a `*Sync` variant that blocks and
returns the value directly:

```javascript
import { Operator } from "opendal";

const op = new Operator("memory");

op.writeSync("hello.txt", "Hello, World!");
const bs = op.readSync("hello.txt");
console.log(bs.toString());
```

The sync variants cover the same operations (`statSync`, `listSync`,
`deleteSync`, …). Use the async API in servers and request handlers; reach for
the sync variants only in scripts and startup code where blocking is acceptable.
