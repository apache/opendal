# Apache OpenDAL™ Python Binding

A native Python binding for OpenDAL: access S3, GCS, Azure Blob, HDFS, the local
filesystem, and [50+ more services](/services) through one API, with the
performance of the Rust core underneath.

New to the model behind the API? Read [Concepts](../../03-concepts.mdx) first —
service, operator, layer, operation are the same four ideas in every language.

:::note
This binding has its own version number, independent of the Rust core. Check
compatibility against the binding's version, not the core's.

## Status

Released and stable, published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opendal/).

## Capabilities

- **Sync and async** — use [`Operator`] or [`AsyncOperator`] with the same verbs.
- **File-like objects** — `op.open(path, "rb")` returns a familiar
  read/write/seek file you can stream through.
- **All services included** — the wheel bundles every backend; there are no
  build flags to enable.
- **Presigned URLs** for services that support them (async API).

## Installation

```shell
pip install opendal
```

## Useful Links

## Next steps

1. [Getting started](./02-getting-started.md) — a runnable program, then a real backend.
2. [Connecting to your storage](./03-connecting.md) — build an operator for any service.
3. [Common tasks](./04-tasks.md) — read, write, stream, list, presign, and more.
4. [Going to production](./05-production.md) — retries, errors, and capability checks.
