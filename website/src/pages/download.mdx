- The KEYS file contains the public keys used for signing release. It is recommended that (when possible) a web of trust is used to confirm the identity of these keys.

- Please download the [KEYS](https://dlcdn.apache.org/incubator/opendal/KEYS) as well as the .asc signature files.

### To verify the signature of the release artifact

You will need to download both the release artifact and the .asc signature file for that artifact. Then verify the signature using:

- Download the KEYS file and the .asc signature files for the relevant release artifacts.
- Import the KEYS file to your GPG keyring:
```
$ gpg --import KEYS
```
- Verify the signature of the release artifact using the following command:
```
$ gpg --verify <artifact>.asc <artifact>
```

### To verify the checksum of the release artifact

You will need to download both the release artifact and the .sha512 checksum file for that artifact. Then verify the checksum using:

```
$ shasum -a 512 -c <artifact>.sha512
```
